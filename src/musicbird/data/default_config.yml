# Default configration file for musicbird.

# The path to your music library that you want to convert.
# Musicbird will only read from this directory, it will never modify your existing library.
#
# Required
source: #"~/music"

# The directory under which the converted copy of your library will be stored. Required
destination: #"~/music_converted"

copy:
  # Whether to copy regular non-audio files found in your library to the mirror. Default: true
  files: true
  # Whether to copy album art image files (such as cover.jpg). This does not affect the album art embedded in audio files.
  # Default: false
  album_art: false

# What to do with files that are already lossy (e.g. MP3s, AAC). Valid options are:
# - copy: Treat the lossy files just like regular files and copy them over
# - convert: Convert lossy files into the format specified in `encoder`. This might result in a loss in quality!
# - ignore: Don't do anything with these files and don't copy them over.
# Default: copy
lossy_files: copy

# By default, musicbird tracks file deletions in your source library and will remove deleted files from the mirrors.
# Set this to false to disable this
prune: true

# Select the encoder to use. You can adjust the encoder settings below.
encoder: mp3
mp3:
  vbr: true # Whether to use VBR encoding instead of CBR. Default: true
  quality: 0 # Quality at which to encode files. 0 = Highest (~220kbit/s), 9 = Lowest
  #bitrate: 320k # Only used for CBR encoding. Sets the bitrate in bit/s
opus:
  bitrate: 128k # Target bitrate of the output files. Default: 128k

# By default, musicird will automatically use all available threads on your system for encoding.
# You can set a cusotm value below, if you so choose.
#threads:

# The type of database musicbird should use for storing information about your library.
# Default: sqlite3 database in $XDG_DATA_HOME/musicbird
# Note that sqlite3 is the only supported database type right now.
